The function name in the header file is different from that in the program body that is; print_msg  and print_msq are different yet they are supposed to be the same in a given program.

The function has arguments yet the declaration indicates that the function has no arguments.
#include <stdio.h>d
void print_msg(void);

main()
{
    print_msg();

    return 0;
}
 void print_msg(void)
                {
                    puts("This is a message to print");
                    return 0;
                }
